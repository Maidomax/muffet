# Muffet

This is a fork of [Muffet](https://github.com/raviqqe/muffet) made into a package that can be used programatically

It exposes a `Crawl(url string) (map[string][]string, error)` method that returns a map of results in a similar manner as the original.

I just hacked it up so it fits my usecase. It works well. If you want to make it better, let me know.
